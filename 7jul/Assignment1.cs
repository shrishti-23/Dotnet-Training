/*
An automated conveyor belt processes 20 packages. Package IDs are generated from 1001 to 1020 using a loop.
For each package:
If the package ID is divisible by 4, it is marked as Quality Check Required.
Else if the package ID is divisible by 5, it is marked as Priority Shipment.
Otherwise, it is marked as Normal Processing.
At the end of the program, display:
Total packages processed
Number of packages requiring quality check
Number of priority shipments
Number of normal packages
